# Keybindings


I'm not doing anything particularly tricky, but I use KeyChord. See [`./modules/keys.py`](../modules/keys.py) for keybinding configuration. If you are using KeyChord, `gen-keybinding-img` will crash. To avoid this, I fixed it. See [Modification of `gen-keybinding-img`](./05_00-keybind.md) for details of the fix.  
Also, if you want to check the image, please refer to [`./keybind-map/`](../keybind-map/).
