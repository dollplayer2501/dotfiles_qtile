# Functions that were used but are no longer used

Initially, I incorporated these functions for learning purposes, but I no longer use them, so I'll list them here. Since I manage it using Git, I've completely deleted them, but if you trace the revisions, you should be able to see the settings.


## Dmenu

The reason is that I don't use this function, so I decided it was unnecessary. I don't need it because I type commands directly from the terminal or use. For now, libqtile.widget.Prompt is sufficient for me. Although the uses are clearly different, I may focus on Popup Toolkit in the future.


## DropDown and ScratchPad

This may be a feature that was too early for me. I found this feature difficult to use, as it also relates to the settings of applications to which floating settings are applied.
