# Project Overview

- This repository contains **MY** Qtile window manager configuration files. It is not intended to be general-purpose.
- There may be inconsistencies between this documentation and the configuration files.

## Purpose

- To document my personal environment and workflow.
- To serve as a reference for future migration to other environments.

## Notes

- The configurations and scripts are **specific to my personal environment**. Use them at your own risk and modify as needed.

I feel the granularity of the file splitting in `docs` is quite coarse (the content is very short).  
If that’s the case, I’d just manage everything in the top-level `README.md` (grr), so please bear with me on this.
